# EVO-sim2
Evolution simulation based on [video](https://youtu.be/N3tRFayqVtk?si=YQMtKYalPkSQOpWn) from David Miller.

## Why?
I found an interest in video mentioned above, because the math and use of NN fascinated me. 
I tried to recreate the simulation in python from scratch, but the performance was not very good. 
Since I moved to uni and startd learning c, I needed some project, that can gain me some experience. 

## Current state
The project is not finished yet. 
Right now the major part of the simulation works, but it runs only in command line.
Next steps would be to implement option to export steps of specific generation to file and create separate program for visualizing and animating it.
