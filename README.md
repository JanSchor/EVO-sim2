# EVO-sim2
Evolution simulation based on [video](https://youtu.be/N3tRFayqVtk?si=YQMtKYalPkSQOpWn) from David Miller.

## Why?
I found an interest in video mentioned above, because the math and use of NN fascinated me. 
I tried to recreate the simulation in python from scratch, but the performance was not very good. 
The [repository](https://github.com/Waaatzon/Evolution) of simulation in python is visible on my github.

Since I moved to uni and started learning C, I needed some project, that can gain me some experience.
This was perfect opportunity to improve the old project and make it in C.

## Current state
The project is not finished yet.

Right now major part of simulation works.
The program does not have visualization in command line anymore, but in separate python file.
Export of brains and generation recordings works now.
Next step would be importing brains and scenario.

* Simulation ✅
* Generation export ✅
* Generation visualization ✅
* Brains export ✅
* Brains visialization ❌
* Generation brains import ❌
* Dynamic running values ✅
* Scenario import ❌
* Scenario creator ❌
* Additional functions and scenarios ❌

There is folder named `export_formats` which has example files for how should the export look.
