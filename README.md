# EVO-sim2
Evolution simulation based on [video](https://youtu.be/N3tRFayqVtk?si=YQMtKYalPkSQOpWn) from David Miller.

## Why?
I found an interest in video mentioned above, because the math and use of NN fascinated me. 
I tried to recreate the simulation in python from scratch, but the performance was not very good. 
The [repository](https://github.com/Waaatzon/Evolution) of simulation in python is visible on my github.

Since I moved to uni and started learning C, I needed some project, that can gain me some experience.
This was perfect opportunity to improve the old project and make it in C.

## Current state
The project is not finished yet. 
Right now the major part of the simulation works, but it runs only in command line.
Currently the export of all the steps in generation is working.
New step would be to create separate program in python to visualize and animate the generation recording.

There is folder named `export_formats` which has example files for how should the export look.
